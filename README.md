# Grover's Algorithm Interactive Simulator 🎯

An interactive **Streamlit app** built with **Qiskit** to demonstrate **Grover’s Search Algorithm**.  
This tool helps students and enthusiasts understand quantum search by simulating the circuit, visualizing amplitude evolution, and exporting results for further study.

---

## 📖 About Grover’s Algorithm
Grover’s algorithm is a **quantum search algorithm** that finds a marked item in an unsorted database of size *N* in **O(√N) time**, offering a quadratic speedup compared to classical search.

This simulator demonstrates:
- Oracle construction for marked states
- The diffusion operator (inversion about the mean)
- Amplitude amplification over iterations
- Measurement probabilities highlighting the solution

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Build and visualize **Grover’s circuit** dynamically  
✅ Run simulations on the **Qiskit AerSimulator**  
✅ Plot **amplitude evolution across iterations**  
✅ Support for **custom marked states**  
✅ Export options:
- Circuit diagram (PNG)
- Measurement results (CSV)
- Amplitude evolution (CSV)
- Animated GIF of amplitude amplification
- PDF tutorial with explanations & circuit diagrams
