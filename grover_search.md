# Problem statement & notation

Given a set of \(N = 2^n\) items (indexed by \(x \in \{0,\dots,N-1\}\)) and an oracle function \(f : \{0,\dots,N-1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\) where
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \text{ is a marked ("solution") item}\\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\]
the goal is to find any \(x\) such that \(f(x)=1\), using as few queries to the oracle as possible.

Notation used below:
- \(M\) = number of marked items (often \(M=1\)).  
- \(|w\rangle\) = normalized equal superposition over marked states.  
- \(|w_\perp\rangle\) = normalized equal superposition over non-marked states.  
- \(|s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_x |x\rangle\) = uniform superposition over all \(N\) states.

---

# High-level idea & comparison to classical search

- **Classical** unstructured search needs \(O(N)\) queries (expected \(\sim N/2\)).  
- **Grover's algorithm** finds a marked item with high probability using \(O(\sqrt{N/M})\) oracle queries — a **quadratic speedup**.  
- It uses **superposition** to represent all items and **interference (amplitude amplification)** to increase amplitude on marked states and decrease it on others.

---

# Algorithm steps (summary)

1. **Initialize:** \(n\) qubits in \(|0\rangle^{\otimes n}\).  
2. **Create uniform superposition:** apply \(H^{\otimes n}\) to get \(|s\rangle\).  
3. **Repeat** the Grover iteration \(G = D \cdot O\) for \(k\) times:
   - Oracle \(O\): flips the phase of marked states.
   - Diffusion \(D\): inversion about the mean (amplitude amplification).
4. **Measure** the computational register. With appropriately chosen \(k\), measurement yields a marked state with high probability.

---

# Oracle and diffusion operator (matrices & circuit)

## Oracle (phase-flip form)
We use a *phase oracle* \(O\) which flips the sign of marked states:
\[
O |x\rangle =
\begin{cases}
-|x\rangle & \text{if } f(x)=1,\\
\;\;|x\rangle & \text{if } f(x)=0.
\end{cases}
\]
For a single marked state \(|w\rangle\) this can be written as:
\[
O = I - 2|w\rangle\langle w| .
\]

(Equivalently, using an ancilla prepared in \(\tfrac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\) and a standard oracle \(U_f: |x\rangle|q\rangle \mapsto |x\rangle|q\oplus f(x)\rangle\) produces the same phase flip on \(|x\rangle\).)

## Diffusion operator (inversion about the mean)
The diffusion operator is:
\[
D = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - I .
\]
Alternate (circuit-friendly) form:
\[
D = H^{\otimes n}\,(2|0\rangle\langle 0| - I)\,H^{\otimes n}.
\]
Matrix action on amplitudes: if the input state is \(\sum_j a_j |j\rangle\) with mean amplitude \(\bar a = \frac{1}{N}\sum_j a_j\), then
\[
D: a_j \mapsto 2\bar a - a_j,
\]
i.e. each amplitude is reflected about the mean.

## Compact matrix representation (all-ones matrix)
Let \(J\) be the \(N\times N\) all-ones matrix. Then:
\[
D = \frac{2}{N} J - I.
\]

# Reduction to a 2D subspace — geometric/rotation view

Grover dynamics remain in the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by:
- \(|w\rangle\) — normalized superposition of marked states (dimension 1),
- \(|w_\perp\rangle\) — normalized superposition of non-marked states (dimension 1).

Express the uniform state \(|s\rangle\) in this basis:
\[
|s\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{M}{N}}\,|w\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{N-M}{N}}\,|w_\perp\rangle.
\]
Define an angle \(\phi\) by
\[
\sin\phi = \sqrt{\frac{M}{N}},\qquad \cos\phi = \sqrt{\frac{N-M}{N}}.
\]
Then
\[
|s\rangle = \sin\phi\,|w\rangle + \cos\phi\,|w_\perp\rangle.
\]

Both the oracle \(O\) and the diffusion \(D\) preserve this 2D subspace; the Grover iteration \(G = D O\) acts as a **rotation** in this plane.

---

# Grover operator as a rotation — derivation

Work in the 2D basis \(\{|w\rangle,|w_\perp\rangle\}\). With that ordering:

- Oracle:
  \[
  O = \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0\\[4pt] 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
  \]
  because it flips the sign of \(|w\rangle\) and leaves \(|w_\perp\rangle\) unchanged.

- Diffusion: recall \(s = \begin{pmatrix}\sin\phi\\ \cos\phi\end{pmatrix}\). Then
  \[
  D = 2 s s^\top - I.
  \]

Compute \(G = D O\). A direct symbolic calculation yields
\[
G = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(2\phi) & \sin(2\phi)\\[4pt] -\sin(2\phi) & \cos(2\phi)\end{pmatrix},
\]
which is a rotation by angle \(\pm 2\phi\) in that 2D subspace. (The sign convention depends on basis orientation; the important fact is that each Grover iteration **rotates** the state vector by angle \(2\phi\).)

Applying \(G\) repeatedly rotates the initial vector \(|s\rangle\) (which is at angle \(\phi\) from \(|w_\perp\rangle\)) closer to \(|w\rangle\).

By induction (or direct calculation),
\[
G^k |s\rangle = \sin((2k+1)\phi)\,|w\rangle + \cos((2k+1)\phi)\,|w_\perp\rangle.
\]

Thus the **amplitude** of the marked subspace after \(k\) iterations is \(\sin((2k+1)\phi)\) and the **success probability** is
\[
P_k = \sin^2\big((2k+1)\phi\big).
\]

---

# Success probability and optimal iterations (derivation)

We want to pick \(k\) to maximize \(P_k = \sin^2((2k+1)\phi)\). The maximum value of \(\sin^2\) is 1, attained when:
\[
(2k+1)\phi \approx \frac{\pi}{2} \quad (\text{mod }\pi).
\]
Solving for \(k\) (choose the smallest nonnegative \(k\) that makes the angle close to \(\pi/2\)):
\[
k \approx \frac{\pi}{4\phi} - \frac{1}{2}.
\]

**Practical integer choice:** choose
\[
k = \operatorname{round}\!\Big(\frac{\pi}{4\phi} - \frac{1}{2}\Big),
\]
i.e. the integer that makes \((2k+1)\phi\) closest to \(\pi/2\).

**Approximation for small \(M/N\):** if \(M\ll N\), then \(\phi = \arcsin\sqrt{M/N} \approx \sqrt{M/N}\), hence
\[
k \approx \frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{\frac{N}{M}}.
\]
This is the familiar \(O(\sqrt{N/M})\) complexity.

**Note on overshoot:** if you apply more than the optimal number of iterations, the amplitude rotates past the target and the success probability decreases — Grover's algorithm must stop near the computed optimal \(k\).

# Worked examples — concrete numbers

Below we show step-by-step amplitude and probability calculations for two small examples (M=1).

### Example 1 — \(N = 4\) (two qubits, one marked state)
- \(M=1\). \(\sin\phi = \sqrt{1/4} = 1/2 \Rightarrow \phi = \arcsin(1/2) = \pi/6 \approx 0.5235988.\)
- Initial state: \(|s\rangle = \sin\phi\,|w\rangle + \cos\phi\,|w_\perp\rangle = \tfrac{1}{2}\,|w\rangle + \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\,|w_\perp\rangle.\)
  - Initial success probability \(P_0 = \sin^2\phi = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 = 0.25.\)
- After \(k=1\) iteration, amplitude on \(|w\rangle\) is \(\sin(3\phi) = \sin(\tfrac{3\pi}{6}) = \sin(\tfrac{\pi}{2}) = 1\).
  - Success probability \(P_1 = 1.0\). So **one** Grover iteration suffices to find the marked element with certainty (ideal noiseless case).

Numeric intermediate (2D basis) matrices and vectors (rounded):
- \(s = [0.5,\; 0.8660254]^\top\).
- Oracle: \(O = \operatorname{diag}(-1,1)\), so \(O s = [-0.5,\; 0.8660254]^\top\).
- Diffusion: \(D = 2 s s^\top - I \approx \begin{pmatrix}-0.5 & 0.8660254\\[2pt] 0.8660254 & 0.5\end{pmatrix}\).
- \(D (O s) \approx [1.0,\; 0]^\top = |w\rangle\).

### Example 2 — \(N = 8\) (three qubits, one marked)
- \(M=1\). \(\sin\phi = \sqrt{1/8} = \tfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.35355339\).
  - \(\phi = \arcsin(0.35355339) \approx 0.361367124\).
- Initial probabilities:
  - \(P_0 = \sin^2(\phi) = 0.125\) (12.5%).
- Choose \(k \approx \operatorname{round}\!\big(\frac{\pi}{4\phi}-\tfrac{1}{2}\big)\):
  - compute value: \(\frac{\pi}{4\phi}-\tfrac{1}{2} \approx 1.6734\) → round → \(k=2\).
- Probabilities:
  - \(k=1\): \(P_1 = \sin^2(3\phi) \approx 0.78125\) (78.125%).
  - \(k=2\): \(P_2 = \sin^2(5\phi) \approx 0.9453125\) (94.5313%) — better; hence \(k=2\) is the practical choice.

These numbers show (i) large improvement with very few iterations, and (ii) the need to choose the nearest integer \(k\), not necessarily the floor.

# Multiple solutions (M > 1)

If there are \(M\) marked items:
- Define \(\sin\phi = \sqrt{M/N}\), \(\cos\phi = \sqrt{(N-M)/N}\).
- The amplitude and rotation formulas remain the same: after \(k\) iterations, success probability
  \[
  P_k = \sin^2((2k+1)\phi).
  \]
- For small \(M/N\), the optimal iteration count becomes
  \[
  k \approx \frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{\frac{N}{M}}.
  \]
- If \(M\) is unknown, one can:
  - use **quantum counting** (phase estimation on the Grover operator) to estimate \(M\), then set \(k\) accordingly; or
  - use probabilistic approaches that vary the number of iterations in a randomized schedule (avoids systematic overshooting).

# Circuit realizations (oracle + diffusion) and notes

## Generic Grover circuit (conceptual)
```

|0...0> -- H^{⊗n} --[repeat k times: ( Oracle O  ->  Diffusion D )]-- Measure

```

## Diffusion gate decomposition (standard)
Implement \(D = H^{\otimes n} (2|0\rangle\langle 0| - I) H^{\otimes n}\).

A typical circuit for \(2|0\rangle\langle 0| - I\) (phase flip on \(|0\rangle\)) uses:
- X gates to turn \(|0\rangle\) into \(|1\rangle\) on all required controls,
- a multi-controlled-Z (or multi-controlled-NOT with ancilla) to flip phase when all qubits are 1,
- undo the X gates.

**Schematic (not gate-level):**
```

-- H -- ... -- O(phase) -- H --
|
[X ... multi-ctrl-Z ... X]

```

For small \(n\) the multi-control can be built from Toffoli gates; for larger \(n\) use ancilla or decomposition strategies (standard in quantum compilation).

## Oracle implementation (notes)
- The oracle that marks a set \(S\) of states can often be implemented as a sequence of controls that detect membership in \(S\) and then perform a phase flip (or flip an ancilla and uncompute).
- If you have a boolean function \(f(x)\) implemented as a unitary \(U_f : |x\rangle|q\rangle \mapsto |x\rangle|q\oplus f(x)\rangle\), prepare the ancilla in \(\frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\). Then \(U_f\) produces the same phase flip on \(|x\rangle\) as \(O\).

---

# Complexity, optimality & limitations

- **Query complexity:** \(O(\sqrt{N/M})\) oracle queries (tight up to constant factors).  
- **Time / gate complexity:** depends on costs of implementing oracle and diffusion; asymptotically dominated by oracle cost × number of iterations.
- **Space:** \(n\) qubits for the input register plus ancilla if needed for multi-control decomposition.
- **Optimality:** Grover's \(\Theta(\sqrt{N})\) query bound is optimal for unstructured search — no quantum algorithm can do substantially better (BBBV lower bound). Grover gives the best possible asymptotic speedup for this black-box search problem.

---

# Practical considerations & variants

- **Overshooting:** running too many iterations reduces success probability — choose \(k\) carefully.  
- **Unknown M:** use quantum counting (phase estimation on Grover operator) to estimate \(M\), or randomized schedules of iterations.  
- **Multiple marked elements:** works naturally; iteration count scales as \(\sqrt{N/M}\).  
- **Noise and error:** realistic quantum hardware noise reduces amplitude amplification efficacy — error mitigation and shorter-depth implementations are important.  
- **Amplitude amplification generalization:** Grover is a special case of amplitude amplification that boosts any known "good" subspace from probability \(p\) to near 1 in \(O(1/\sqrt{p})\) steps.  
- **Quantum counting:** uses phase estimation on the Grover operator to estimate the eigenphase (related to \(M\)), enabling an estimate of the number of solutions.

# Appendix: useful matrix forms and quick identities

- Uniform state:
  \[
  |s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}|x\rangle.
  \]
- Diffusion operator:
  \[
  D = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - I = \frac{2}{N}J - I,
  \quad
  J_{ij} = 1\ \forall i,j.
  \]
- Oracle (single marked state \(|w\rangle\)):
  \[
  O = I - 2|w\rangle\langle w|.
  \]
- Grover operator eigenvalues (restricted to the 2D subspace):
  \[
  \lambda_{\pm} = e^{\pm i 2\phi},
  \]
  where \(\sin\phi = \sqrt{M/N}\).
- Amplitude after \(k\) iterations:
  \[
  \text{amp}_w(k) = \sin\big((2k+1)\phi\big),\qquad
  P_k = \sin^2\big((2k+1)\phi\big).
  \]

# Short summary (one-liner)
Grover's algorithm uses repeated phase inversion (oracle) and inversion-about-mean (diffusion) to rotate the state vector in a 2D subspace toward the marked states; by choosing roughly \(k\approx\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N/M}\) iterations one amplifies solution amplitudes from \(O(1/\sqrt{N})\) to nearly 1, giving an optimal quadratic speedup for unstructured search.
